üîπ 1. Hardware Architecture  
Each robot unit is a mobile platform with the following features:

-‚ÄØMicrocontroller or SBC (e.g., STM32, ESP32, Raspberry Pi Zero): Handles onboard computation and communication.  
-‚ÄØMotors & Encoders: Two motors (differential drive) for movement and direction control.  
-‚ÄØSensors:  
  - Line following sensors or LIDAR/IR for navigation.  
  - Proximity sensors for collision avoidance.  
-‚ÄØWireless Modules: Typically Wi-Fi (ESP-NOW or mesh) to communicate with other agents or a central server.  
-‚ÄØBattery-powered: Robots are untethered and designed to run autonomously.

üîπ 2. Swarm Intelligence Algorithm  
Swarm robotics is modeled after biological systems like ant colonies or bee hives. Key concepts used:

-‚ÄØLocal decision-making: Each robot operates on partial data, without a centralized controller.  
-‚ÄØSelf-organization: Robots form dynamic formations, avoid traffic, and organize tasks by collaborating.  
-‚ÄØStigmergy: Robots may leave markers (e.g., via messages or visible tokens) that influence the behavior of others.

Common algorithms:  
- Finite state machines for task logic.  
- Boid-style movement for collision avoidance (alignment, cohesion, separation).  
- Leader-follower dynamics in crowded environments.

üîπ 3. Task Allocation System  
Robots work in a simulated warehouse where tasks involve picking and delivering packages. Task assignment can use:

- Market-based bidding: Each robot ‚Äúbids‚Äù for a task based on its proximity and availability.  
- Greedy heuristics: Robot takes the nearest available task.  
- Broadcast assignment: A master node (or elected leader) distributes tasks.  
- Token-passing: A logical token determines which robot can take a task.

Tasks are dynamically updated based on system load, traffic, or task completion.

üîπ 4. Path Planning and Motion  
Each robot must navigate the warehouse grid to pick up and deliver items. The methods used include:

- A* Algorithm: Calculates shortest path between current position and goal node.  
- Real-time re-routing: If path is blocked (by other robots or obstacles), the robot recalculates a new path.  
- Traffic management: Robots slow down or yield at intersections to prevent collisions.  
- Grid localization: Robots track position on a 2D matrix map, possibly using odometry or QR tags.

üîπ 5. Communication Protocol  
Robots communicate peer-to-peer or with a central node. Communication is lightweight to reduce bandwidth usage:

- ESP-NOW or Wi-Fi (UDP/TCP packets).  
- Each robot broadcasts its ID, status (busy/idle), position, and current goal.  
- Collision prevention is done via negotiation‚Äîrobots adjust based on priority or timestamp.

Swarm communication is often event-triggered (i.e., robots only communicate when needed).

üîπ 6. Environment Setup  
The simulated environment mimics a warehouse, segmented into:

- Storage zones: Where packages are kept.  
- Transit corridors: Main lanes for robot navigation.  
- Delivery zones: Drop-off or packaging stations.

Zones may be color-coded or marked with visual tags (e.g., AprilTags) for localization.

üîπ 7. Software Stack & Simulation  
- Robot Operating System (ROS) or a custom Python/C++ stack is used.  
- Simulations are run using Unity or Gazebo for testing multi-agent behaviors before deployment.  
- Real-time visualization helps monitor robot paths, task status, and overall performance.

The system is designed to test scalability, showing how 5, 10, or more robots can coordinate without centralized control.

üîπ 8. Performance & Optimization  
- Performance is measured using:
  - Task completion rate.
  - Average time per delivery.
  - Robot idle time.
  - Collision incidents.

- Optimization techniques include:
  - Load balancing.
  - Smart routing (avoiding traffic).
  - Dynamic speed adjustment.


the goal locations and robot movements are handled via a combination of grid-based planning and external tracking:

üìç Goal Locations:

The warehouse is modeled as a 2D grid.

Each grid cell represents a zone (e.g., pick-up, drop-off).

Goal positions (e.g., where to pick or place packages) are pre-defined in a shared map and given as coordinates (X, Y) to the robots.

üõ∞Ô∏è Robot Movement Tracking:

The system uses a top-down external camera and computer vision to track each robot's position in real-time.

Each robot is likely tagged with a unique pattern (like ArUco/AprilTag) for easy ID and localization.
